## Plugin Installation and configuration

 First install SQL file with component tables and included components
 You can install the file in SQL Workshop-Scripts where you run it as new script or in your database:
```sql
 type_components.sql
 ```
 Then import the plugin into your application from this file:
```sql
 region_type_plugin_pretius_drawing_plugin.sql
  ```
  For the plugin configuration follow this steps:
  
 1. Create region of type "Pretius Drawing Plugin"
 2. Set collection name in region attributes
 3. Choose if the plugin should be displayed with or without editor:
     1. If the editor is active, users can drag & drop components onto the plan and edit them
     2. Save button will save all the components into chosen collection
     3. When is editor option disabled, user can define onClick behavior in onClick column, so the plan can be interactive and users can for example book a place in an office or parking spot
 4. Set the region query as below:
  
Example query:

```sql
select
	C001 as width,
	C002 as height,
	C003 as  top,
	C004 as left,
	C005 as class,
	C006 as  text,
	C007 as available,
	C008 as spot_id,
	C009 as rotate,
	case  
		when C005 like  '%workspace-seat%'  then  'selectSpot('|| C008 ||')'
		else  'alert('||C008||')'
	end  as onClick,
	c010 as innerHtml
from apex_collections
where collection_name = 'MY_COLLECTION'
order by seq_id;
```
Query contains columns that define component size, location and visualization.
It does not have to use apex_collections, you can load saved results directly from the table.

 - **Width** and **Height**: size of the component
 - **Top** and **Left**: component position
 - **Class**: CSS classes, define component visualization
 - **Text**: if the component contains input field, it will be saved into Text column
 - **Available**: can be used to restrict interactivity of the component
 - **Spot_id**: auto generated id of the component, unique identifier
 - **Rotate**: rotate CSS value in degrees
 - **Onclick**: user defined function that will be triggered on click, example below add function selectSpot(id) to component that has class workspace-seat (Workplace component that visualize as office chair) and alert(id) for any other component 
 ```sql
 case 
	 when C005 like  '%workspace-seat%'  then  'selectSpot('|| C008 ||')'
	 else  'alert('||C008||')'
end  as onClick
 ```
<div  style="float: left"><p  align="center">
<img  src="readme_files/plugin3.gif"  width="800"  />
</p></div>
<div  style="float: left"><p  align="center">
<img  src="readme_files/plugin4.gif"  width="800"  />
</p></div>

 - **Innerhtml**: this column contains any inner html from complicated components, when recreated, the inner html is inserted into main component div, so the visualization stays the same

### Change the scale of the plan (zoom in and out)
Change the scale of the planner using plus. minus and fit buttons. 
To control height and width of div containing the plan, you can manually add css to div with class "zoom-additional-container".

<div  style="float: left"><p  align="center">
<img  src="readme_files/resize_settings.png"  width="800"  />
</p></div>

### Add planner background
To add planner background simply upload the image into Application static files and use the name of the file in plugin background settings. You can also set the opacity of the background.

<div  style="float: left"><p  align="center">
<img  src="readme_files/background-options2.png"  width="800"  />
</p></div>
<div  style="float: left"><p  align="center">
<img  src="readme_files/adding-background.gif"  width="800"  />
</p></div>

## User Manual
[Link to User manual](user_manual.md)

## Components settings
All the components are in table PLAN_TYPE (category of the components) and TYPE_COMPONENT.
You can create additional components / component types and add them into tables. Use code column for your HTML and CSS column for styling. It will be automatically loaded into the plugin and you can use it to create your visualizations.

<div>
<img  src="readme_files/comp1.png"  width="33%"  />
<img  src="readme_files/comp2.png"  width="33%"  />
<img  src="readme_files/comp3.png"  width="33%"  />
</div>
 

## Known issues and future development
 1. Feature: Drag all selected items at once
 2. Error: Some components get selected when draged around or resized

## Calibration
To enhance the precision of drag & drop, we have included Left and Top margin attributes in the region settings. This allows you to fine-tune the drop position.
